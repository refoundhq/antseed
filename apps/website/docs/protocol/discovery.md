# Peer Discovery

The discovery protocol uses a DHT network (built on BEP 5) as a decentralized directory of seller nodes, combined with an HTTP metadata endpoint for retrieving provider details and Skills. All nodes bootstrap through dedicated AntSeed infrastructure.

## DHT Topic Hashing

Sellers announce multiple topic types. Each topic is SHA1-hashed for DHT lookup.

| Topic Type | Plain Topic String | Key Normalization |
|---|---|---|
| Provider | `antseed:{provider}` | `trim + lowercase` |
| Model (canonical) | `antseed:service:{model}` | `trim + lowercase` |
| Model (search fallback) | `antseed:service-search:{model}` | `trim + lowercase`, then remove spaces, `-`, `_` (keep `.`) |
| Capability | `antseed:{capability}` or `antseed:{capability}:{name}` | `trim + lowercase` |

`model-search` topics are announced only when the compact key differs from the canonical key.

Example:

- `kimi 2.5` -> canonical `antseed:service:kimi 2.5`, search `antseed:service-search:kimi2.5`
- `kimi-2.5` -> canonical `antseed:service:kimi-2.5`, search `antseed:service-search:kimi2.5`
- `kimi_2.5` -> canonical `antseed:service:kimi_2.5`, search `antseed:service-search:kimi2.5`

Buyer model discovery queries canonical model topic first, then also queries `model-search` when keys differ.

## Bootstrap Nodes

| Host | Port |
|---|---|
| `dht1.antseed.com` | 6881 |
| `dht2.antseed.com` | 6881 |

## DHT Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Port | 6881 |
| Re-announce interval | 15 minutes |
| Operation timeout | 10 seconds |

## Metadata Endpoint

Each seller runs an HTTP server exposing `GET /metadata` which returns JSON-serialized `PeerMetadata` with pricing, capacity, and optional metadata tags/protocol hints.  
By default, metadata is fetched from `http://{host}:{port}/metadata` (`metadataPortOffset = 0`).

## PeerMetadata

```json title="metadata structure"
{
  "peerId": "a1b2c3d4...40 hex chars (EVM address)",
  "version": 10,
  "displayName": "Acme Inference - us-east-1",
  "publicAddress": "peer.example.com:6882",
  "providers": [{

    },

    ]
  },
  "signature": "eip191...130 hex chars"
}
```

Recommended category tags: `privacy`, `legal`, `uncensored`, `coding`, `finance`, `tee` (custom tags are allowed).

`publicAddress` is optional. When present, buyers should prefer it over the raw host learned from the DHT announcement. This is intended for deployments where DHT traffic exits from one IP but buyers must connect to another address, such as a Kubernetes load balancer.

`sellerContract` is optional. When present, buyers use the contract as the on-chain seller address and verify separately that the peer identity is an authorized operator of that contract.

`verifications` is optional. It carries external ownership claims that are included in the signed metadata. Domain and GitHub proofs bind to `peerId` — not to `sellerContract` — because the peer identity is the key that signs discovery metadata and operates the node.

## Domain and GitHub Verification Claims

Domain verification supports two proof transports:

- DNS TXT at `_antseed.<domain>` with value `antseed-peer=<peer-id-without-0x>`
- HTTPS well-known JSON at `https://<domain>/.well-known/antseed.json`

A DNS-backed claim looks like:

```json
{
  "domain": "provider.example.com",
  "methods": ["dns-txt"]
}
```

The matching DNS record is:

```text
_antseed.provider.example.com TXT "antseed-peer=a1b2c3d4...40hex"
```

An HTTPS well-known proof uses this JSON shape:

```json
{
  "type": "antseed-domain-verification",
  "peerId": "a1b2c3d4...40hex",
  "domain": "provider.example.com"
}
```

GitHub verification fetches a public file from:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repository>/HEAD/antseed.json
```

The proof file shape is:

```json
{
  "type": "antseed-github-verification",
  "peerId": "a1b2c3d4...40hex",
  "username": "example-org"
}
```

The repository name is part of the metadata claim, not the proof file. If no repository is provided, verifiers use the profile repository named after the username.

Verifiers reject redirected proof URLs. Domain and GitHub proofs must be served directly from the claimed domain or GitHub account path.

## Peer Scoring

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Price | 0.30 | Lower price scores higher (inverted min-max) |
| Latency | 0.25 | Lower latency scores higher (EMA-based) |
| Capacity | 0.20 | More available capacity scores higher |
| Reputation | 0.10 | Higher reputation scores higher (0-100) |
| Freshness | 0.10 | Recently seen peers score higher |
| Reliability | 0.05 | Lower failure rate and streak scores higher |

All factors are min-max normalized across the eligible candidate pool. By default there is no minimum reputation gate (`minPeerReputation: 0`); buyers can explicitly raise it to exclude lower-reputation peers before scoring. Peers in a failure cooldown (exponential backoff) are also excluded.

Buyers can filter by capability, Skill, minimum reputation, and price ceiling.
