/**
 * Build the `NodePaymentsConfig` an ad-hoc `AntseedNode` needs to enrich peers
 * with on-chain stats (channel count, ghost count, total volume, last-settled).
 * Used by short-lived buyer nodes spun up by `antseed network browse` and
 * `antseed network peer` when a buyer daemon isn't already running.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when the chain can't be resolved (missing `chainId`,
 * RPC, or contract addresses) so callers can gracefully skip on-chain
 * enrichment instead of erroring out. The caller is responsible for deciding
 * what to do with `undefined` — typically: skip the enrichment loop and show
 * on-chain columns as "—".
 *
 * The `stakingAddress` + `identityRegistryAddress` wiring is critical: without
 * them `AntseedNode._initializePayments` never creates a `StakingClient` /
 * `IdentityClient`, which gates the on-chain verification loop in
 * `discoverPeers()`.
